# Sports Club Management System

This is a custom-built sports club management system, developed as part of my learning journey in modern web technologies such as **Laravel**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Alpine.js**. The project is designed to help me improve my backend and frontend development skills by building a real-life, full-stack application from scratch.

While the main purpose of this project is educational and portfolio-building, I do not exclude the possibility of developing it into a commercial product in the future.

## Features (current and planned)
- User registration and login
- Member management
- Admin panel
- Payment system and membership statuses
- Reports and statistics
- Internal communication module
- Events and training calendar

## Technologies Used
- Laravel 12 (backend framework)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
- Alpine.js (lightweight JavaScript framework for interactivity)
- MySQL (relational database)
- PHP 8.2+

All technologies are being used as part of my learning process, with a strong focus on writing clean, reusable, and scalable code.

## Project Status
This project is under active development. It was created as part of my personal commitment to mastering web development, especially using the Laravel ecosystem. It may be expanded in the future for real-world club use.
